What is Apache Kafka and why is it used?
########################################

Apache Kafka is a distributed event-streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to publish, store, and process large volumes of data in the form of events or messages with very high throughput and low latency. Kafka is used because it can handle massive data streams reliably, scale horizontally across multiple servers, and ensure fault tolerance by replicating data. It allows different systems to communicate asynchronously, decouples producers and consumers.
